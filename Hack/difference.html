How it  is differ from brand medicine</h3>  </center></font>
<font size="4" align="justify">

<ul>
<li>The difference between a brand-name product and a generic.</br></li>
<li>A brand-name drug product is originally discovered and developed by a pharmaceutical company.</br></li>
In order for the company to market and sell their product they must first again  approval from from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by submitting a new Drug Applocation.</br></li>
<li>In this documentation the company submits data to establish a drug's clinical safety and efficiency.Other studies determine the characteristics of the drug dosage form,including the manufacturing   process,drug stability,purity,strength,and how it dissolves.</br></li>
<li>Once the drug receives FDA approval ,the innovator company can the exclusively market and sell this 'brand name' product for as long as the company has patent protection.</br></li>
<li>A 2000 study published in the journal of health economics estimated that bringing a new drug to market costs the innovator on average $802 million over a period of 10 to15 years.</br></li>
<li>A patent allows the innovator to sell its product exclusively in order to recoup money spent during developement and to generate a profit.</br></li>
<li>The difference between a brand-name product and a generic one is designed to the transparent.</br></li>
<li>Once the patent life expires on a brand-name drug product, it is eligible to be made in to a "generic drug".</br></li>
<li>The drug may differ in color, shape, taste, inactive ingredients, preservatives and packaging, however.Because of these differences, the generic drug manufacturers are required to submit additional paper work to the FDA to prove that their product is manufactured in accordance with good manufacturing practices (GMPs), and is as pure and stable as the brand-name product.Additionally, the generic needs to meet pharmacokinetic parameters in the body, which means it must dissolve (in a beaker) at the same rate and to the same extent as the original.</br></li>
<li>This process ensures that the two products are bioequivalent becouse if product A and product B dissolve in a virtually identical manner, then they should behave the same in the body.</br> </li>
